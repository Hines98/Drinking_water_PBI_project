# Access to Drinking Water

## Contexte
Context
I am a Data Analyst consultant on a mission for the NGO DWFA (Drinking Water For All). This NGO aims to provide access to drinking water for everyone and has three areas of expertise:
- Creation of drinking water access services
- Modernization of existing drinking water access services
- Consulting for administrations/governments on water access policies
The organization has submitted a funding request to a donor by presenting these three areas of expertise.
If granted, this new funding could be invested in one of these areas of expertise in a country that has yet to be determined.

## Objectif
As part of this initiative, I have been assigned to create a dashboard that provides a global overview of access to drinking water. This dashboard will help determine the target country once the donor has decided which area of expertise they wish to finance.
