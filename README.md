# Access to Drinking Water

## Context
Context
I am a Data Analyst consultant on a mission for the NGO DWFA (Drinking Water For All). This NGO aims to provide access to drinking water for everyone and has three areas of expertise:
- Creation of drinking water access services
- Modernization of existing drinking water access services
- Consulting for administrations/governments on water access policies
The organization has submitted a funding request to a donor by presenting these three areas of expertise.
If granted, this new funding could be invested in one of these areas of expertise in a country that has yet to be determined.

## Objective
As part of this initiative, I have been assigned to create a dashboard that provides a global overview of access to drinking water. This dashboard will help determine the target country once the donor has decided which area of expertise they wish to finance.

## Dashboard
Selection of Priority Countries Will Be Based on the Following Criteria:
- Low access to drinking water
- High WASH-related mortality rate
- Political stability allowing for effective intervention
  
#### 1. Global Analysis
Significant disparities exist between countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. Some countries have extremely low access rates, highlighting an urgent need for intervention. Countries such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone have high mortality rates but also face political instability. The lack of infrastructure and inadequate basic services contribute to these alarming figures. Countries with pronounced political instability generally have lower access to drinking water. Conflicts and humanitarian crises hinder the development of water infrastructure.

#### 2. Continental Analysis
- Africa: Highest mortality rate due to unsafe water, insufficient water infrastructure.
- Southeast Asia: Progress varies by country, but some still struggle.
- Latin America: Overall better situation, but pockets of poverty persist.
Some regions show consistent improvement in water access, while others stagnate or even regress.

#### 3. National Analysis
The growth of the rural population relative to the total population highlights an increasing need for water infrastructure. Conversely, urban expansion tends to improve access to water, but rural populations remain disadvantaged. A low political stability index is often correlated with difficulties in ensuring quality water services.

#### Recommendations
- Urgent needs for water infrastructure and management in politically stable countries: Mongolia, Bhutan, Vanuatu, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
- Other countries to monitor: West African countries and some Southeast Asian nations.
